            Your bedroom environment plays a crucial role in determining the quality of your sleep. Creating an ideal sleep sanctuary involves optimizing several key factors that influence your ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep throughout the night.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Temperature Control</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            Your body naturally cools down as you prepare for sleep, so keeping your bedroom at a cool temperature (around 65-68°F or 18-20°C) can facilitate this process. Consider using breathable bedding, adjusting your thermostat, or using a fan to maintain optimal temperature. If you tend to get cold during the night, opt for warming pajamas instead of raising the room temperature.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Light Management</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            Darkness signals to your brain that it's time to produce melatonin, the hormone responsible for sleep. Invest in blackout curtains or eye masks to eliminate light sources. If you need a nightlight, choose red or amber lights, which have less impact on melatonin production. Also, make sure to eliminate light from electronic devices by turning them away from your bed or using covers.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            During the day, expose yourself to bright light to strengthen your circadian rhythm. Open your curtains immediately after waking up to help regulate your internal clock.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Sound Optimization</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            While some people prefer complete silence, others find white noise or ambient sounds helpful for sleep. If outside noise disrupts your sleep, consider earplugs, a white noise machine, or a fan to mask disturbing sounds. Alternatively, you can play gentle nature sounds or soft instrumental music designed for sleep.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            If you're sensitive to sound, ensure your bedroom door seals well and consider adding rugs or soft furnishings to absorb sound reflections.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Bedding and Mattress Quality</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            A supportive mattress and comfortable pillows are fundamental to quality sleep. Replace your mattress every 7-10 years, or sooner if you wake up with pain or notice sagging. Choose pillows that support your neck and head in alignment with your spine.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            Select bedding materials based on your temperature preferences and sensitivities. Breathable fabrics like cotton, bamboo, or linen help regulate temperature. For sheets, thread count isn't as important as fabric quality and personal preference.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Decluttering and Organization</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            A cluttered bedroom can contribute to mental stress and make it harder to relax. Keep your sleeping space organized and free from work materials, electronics, and other distractions. Consider creating a calming aesthetic with soothing colors and minimal decor.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            If possible, avoid using your bedroom for work or other stressful activities. Train your brain to associate the bedroom primarily with sleep and relaxation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Air Quality</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            Good air quality contributes to better sleep. Ensure your bedroom is well-ventilated and consider using an air purifier if you have allergies or live in an area with poor air quality. Adding plants like snake plants or peace lilies can help purify the air naturally.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            Keep humidity levels between 30-50% for optimal comfort. A humidifier or dehumidifier may be necessary depending on your climate.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Electronics Management</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            The blue light emitted by screens can suppress melatonin production and delay sleep onset. Implement a "digital sunset" by turning off electronic devices at least one hour before bedtime. If you must use devices, enable blue light filters or wear blue light blocking glasses.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-white">
            Charge your phone outside the bedroom if possible, or at least place it face-down and away from your pillow to reduce temptation and electromagnetic exposure.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-white">
            Creating an ideal sleep environment requires attention to multiple factors, but the investment pays dividends in improved sleep quality. Start with the most significant changes that address your biggest sleep disruptions, then gradually optimize other aspects of your bedroom environment. Remember that small improvements can lead to substantial improvements in sleep quality.
